				    <p class="paragraph"><h2 class="heading2"> Open Source</h2></p>CruiseControl.NET is an Open Source project. This means it is free to use, and the source code is also available and distributable under a few conditions. Our <a href="License.html">License</a> is very similar to the Apache &amp; BSD licenses.<p class="paragraph"><h2 class="heading2"> Project Management</h2></p>The CruiseControl.NET source trees and email lists are hosted on SourceForge under the <span class="nobr"><a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/ccnet">ccnet<sup><img src="./icons/linkext7.gif" height="7" width="7" align="absmiddle" alt="&gt;&gt;" border="0"/></sup></a></span> project.<p class="paragraph">We don&#039;t use Sourceforge for bug and feature tracking, instead look at our <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Issues">Issues</a> page.</p>At ThoughtWorks we believe in lightweight methodologies. This fits in well with an open source project so project decisions tend to be made in an ad-hoc fashion, normally by some kind of consesus on the <em class="emphasis">CCNet-Devel</em> <a href="Mailing Lists.html">mailing list</a>.<p class="paragraph"><h2 class="heading2"> Submitting updates</h2></p>We welcome patches and updates to the code and documentation for CruiseControl.NET. If you want to do this, the best way is to email the ccnet-devel list with your change.<p class="paragraph">The format of your submission ideally should be a description of what you have done, along with an associated CVS patch (if you don&#039;t know how to create a CVS patch, you probably want to use Eclipse as your CVS client since it has a good GUI for creating them). If your patch includes files &gt; 40kb, please don&#039;t send it to the list. Instead, email the list with a description of your patch, and one of the admin team will reply off-list so that you can send the files just to one person.</p>
