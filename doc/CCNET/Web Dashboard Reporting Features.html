				    <p class="paragraph">This is preliminary documentation for new features in the Web Dashboard to provide reporting and configuration features.</p><img src="./icons/emoticons/warning.png" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> These new features are still <b class="strong">in development</b> and should <b class="strong">not</b> be considered to be &#039;production ready&#039;. Some reporting features (e.g. FxCop reporting) have not yet been included in the new reporting pages, but these will be added soon. Use these new features at your own risk! <img src="./icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>&#160;<p class="paragraph">The new features in the Web Dashboard consolidate the previous, separate, Web and Web Dashboard applications, plus also will provide the following new features:</p><ul type="square" class="minus">
<li> Multi-project, multi-server support. Now you just need 1 deployment of the web application to report over all your CCNet projects. (<em class="emphasis">This code is complete, but some reporting features have not yet been migrated</em>)</li>
<li> Project Configuration. Add, edit and delete projects through the web application on any CCNet build server (remote or local to the web application) (<em class="emphasis">This code is still in early days. Only some scenarios using Perforce, File Source Control, Command Line Builder and NAnt Builder have been implemented</em>)</li>
</ul><br/>
The features are being used on CCNetLive at <a href="http://ccnetlive.thoughtworks.com/ccnet/" title="Visit page outside Confluence">&#104;ttp://ccnetlive.thoughtworks.com/ccnet/</a><p class="paragraph"><img src="./icons/emoticons/warning.png" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> If you do want to use the new web application, please note the <b class="strong">SECURITY</b> section below.</p><img src="./icons/emoticons/information.png" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> The &#039;plugins&#039; API for the new web application is completely different to that for the old web application. Documentation on writing your own plugins will come later.<p class="paragraph"><h3 class="heading3"><a name="WebDashboardReportingFeatures-60secondsetupguide"> 60 second setup guide</a></h3></p>To setup the new Web Dashboard features, just run through the instructions on the <a href="Web Dashboard.html" title="Web Dashboard">Web Dashboard</a> page.<p class="paragraph"><h3 class="heading3"><a name="WebDashboardReportingFeatures-SecurityandtheCCNetwebapplication"> Security and the CCNet web application</a></h3></p>Certain features within the CCNet web application could allow a user to seriously damage the setup of the machine that a build server is hosted on. Unless you trust everyone with access to your deployed web application, do the following:
<ol>
<li> Open up the <em class="emphasis">web.config</em> file in the root directory of your deployed web application</li>
<li> Look for a line that says <tt class="monospaced">&lt;add key=&quot;AllowSecureActions&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;</tt></li>
<li> Delete this line, comment it, or change the <tt class="monospaced">value</tt> setting to false</li>
<li> Save the file</li>
</ol><br/>
This process will disable all actions that could compromise your build servers, including all configuration features.<p class="paragraph"><h3 class="heading3"><a name="WebDashboardReportingFeatures-Usageguide"> Usage guide</a></h3></p>This part of the documentation is very sparse at the moment, and some of the instructions here <b class="strong">will</b> change once more features are added (and bugs are fixed!)<p class="paragraph">At the moment, you need to update the <tt class="monospaced">&lt;webURL&gt;</tt> tag for each project in your build server (this will be updated soon). The format of the URL should be the following:
<ul class="star">
<li> <tt class="monospaced">&lt;webURL&gt;http://<em class="emphasis">hostname</em>/<em class="emphasis">VirtualDirectory</em>/Controller.aspx?&#95;action&#95;ViewProjectReport=true&amp;server=<em class="emphasis">Server Name</em>&amp;project=<em class="emphasis">Project Name</em>&lt;/webURL&gt;</tt></li>
</ul>
<ul class="star">
<li> <em class="emphasis">Server Name</em> is the name of the server that you set in the &#039;web.config&#039; file for the web application. If you didn&#039;t set anything, it will just be <em class="emphasis">local</em></li>
<li> <em class="emphasis">Project Name</em> is the same as the name that you set for the project in the config file.</li>
<li> In both of the above, make sure to replace any spaces in server and project names with <b class="strong"><tt class="monospaced">%20</tt></b>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="heading4"><a name="WebDashboardReportingFeatures-Viewingprojects"> Viewing projects</a></h4></p>Assuming you&#039;ve set everything up OK, you should be able to view the default page in the Virtual Directory you setup for your web application. The default page on CCNetLive is at <a href="http://ccnetlive.thoughtworks.com/ccnet/" title="Visit page outside Confluence">&#104;ttp://ccnetlive.thoughtworks.com/ccnet/</a>, and you should see something similar.<p class="paragraph">What you are seeing here is the <em class="emphasis">farm view</em>. There are 4 different views in the CCNet Web Application, with increasingly narrower scope. Here&#039;s a brief description:
<ul class="star">
<li> <b class="strong">Farm</b> - shows all projects running on all servers. Drill down into a project by clicking on its name</li>
<li> <b class="strong">Server</b> - shows all projects running on a server. From here you can also view the &#039;server log&#039;, and add projects to a server</li>
<li> <b class="strong">Project</b> - Shows a summary of the current state of a summary, shows the recent builds, and allows project configuration. Drill down into a specific build by clicking on its name</li>
<li> <b class="strong">Build</b> - This is the equivalent of the old CCNet web application. Here you can view the results of a build in various ways (summary report, full log, FxCop results, etc.)</li>
</ul><br/>
Note the <b class="strong">location bar</b> near the top of the page - this allows you to back-track up through the views.</p><h4 class="heading4"><a name="WebDashboardReportingFeatures-Projectconfiguration"> Project configuration</a></h4><p class="paragraph"><img src="./icons/emoticons/warning.png" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> Project configuration support is in very early days - we recommend you don&#039;t use it now and come back to it later. If you do have any questions about the project configuration features, please mail the ccnet-devel list.</p>
