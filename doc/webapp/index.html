		<h1>Installing and Configuring the Web Application</h1>
		<p>The CCNet Web Application is used for reporting the status of all the builds for a project. To install it:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Unzip the distribution as described in <a href="../basicinstallation.html">Basic Installation</a></li>
			<li>In IIS, map a virtual directory to the 'web' subfolder of your CCNet folder</li>
		</ol>
		<p>To configure the webapp, set the 'logDir' value in the 'appSettings' section of the web.config folder. By default,
		its set to be the 'log' sub-directory of the web folder, but if your Server's 'xmllogger' task is creating its log files
		elsewhere you'll need to update this.</p>
		<p>Further customization of the webapp is described <a href="customization.html">here</a>.</p>
