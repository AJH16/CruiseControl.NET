		<h1>Basic Installation</h1>
		<p>Once you've got hold of a CCNet binary distribution (see <a href="obtaining.html">
				<i>Obtaining</i></a>), unzip it into a folder on your system. (If you're 
			using Windows XP or 2003 with built in zip-file browsing, don't just use rely 
			on this feature - actually unzip the distribution!)</p>
		<p>Inside this folder you'll see sub-folders for the different applications 
			that form CruiseControl.NET, as described in the <a href="introToCCNet.html">CCNet Overview</a>.
			There's also a documentation folder relevant to the 
			version of CruiseControl.NET you obtained.</p>
		<p>There's detailed help for each application linked from the documentation <a href="index.html">index</a>.</p>
