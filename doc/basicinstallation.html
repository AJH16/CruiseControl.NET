		<h1>Basic Installation</h1>
		<p>Once you've got hold of a CCNet binary distribution (see <a href="obtaining.html">
				<i>Obtaining</i></a>), unzip it into a folder on your system. (If you're 
			using Windows XP or 2003 with built in zip-file browsing, don't just use rely 
			on this feature - actually unzip the distribution!)</p>
		<p>Inside this folder you'll see sub-folders for all the different applications 
			that form CruiseControl.NET, plus a documentation folder relevant to the 
			version of CruiseControl.NET you obtained. Here is a quick description of each 
			application, plus links to where to go next in the documentation tree:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="runner/index.html"><b>runner</b></a>&nbsp;- 
				This is the main CruiseControl.NET Continuous Integration Engine which you need to get
				working before you look at the rest of this list. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="webapp/index.html"><b>web</b></a>&nbsp;- 
				The main CruiseControl.NET reporting application (an ASP.NET web app), 
				which gives a breakdown for each of your builds.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="webdashboard/index.html"><b>dashboard</b></a>&nbsp;- 
				An ASP.NET monitoring application that gives you status 
				information for your build, or set of builds on your network.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="cctray/index.html"><b>cctray</b></a>&nbsp;- 
			- A client System Tray application that enables you to see the state of your 
			build from any machine on your network.
			</li>
		</ul>
