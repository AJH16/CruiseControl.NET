<h1>Exception Handling in the CruiseControl.NET Server</h1>

<p>This document outlines the likely causes of exceptions that can occur within CruiseControl.NET and how the
CruiseControl.NET server attempts to handle these exceptions when they are raised.  There are two broad
scenarios for the generation of exceptions: during initialisation and during operation.</p>

<h2>Initialisation Phase Exception Handling</h2>
<p>Initialisation exceptions occur when the server is launched.  These exceptions are typically related to
invalid server or remoting configuration data.  Initialisation exceptions will cause the server to shut down immediately
and report the exception to the console for the command-line runner and to the system event log for the Windows Service
runner.</p>

<h2>Operational Phase Exception Handling</h2>
<p>Once the CruiseControl server has started, non-fatal exceptions will be handled and reported by the server without the
requiring .
as gracefully as possible.

<h2>Configuration Exceptions</h2>
Configuration exceptions are caused by errors in the configuration file.  This is typically related to either malformed document
structure (ie. violates XML that violated well-formedness constraints) or to content that violates the CruiseControl.NET
configuration object model as described by the configuration schema (ccnet.xsd).
