	<p/>
	<h3>Development Practices</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Test-first development.  Code without unit tests will not be accepted.</li>
		<li>Refactor mercilessly; however, notify the list before making large, broad-reaching refactorings.</li>
		<li>Small methods (no more than 15 lines).  Long methods will be collected and emailed to the list until a refactored solution is found.</li>
		<li>Use guard clauses.</li>
		<li>Write acceptance tests wherever possible.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Coding Standards</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Respect the brace style.  Curly braces at the start of the line:
<pre>
		public Class Foo
		{
			public Foo()
			{
				Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
			}
		}
</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Use C# naming conventions: methods, properties, classes should all start with upper-case letters.
		</li>
		<li>Namespaces should all be in lowercase and should (typically) reflect the directory structure.
		</li>
		<li>One file, one class -- unless the inner class is private.</li>
		<li>All member variables should be prefixed with an underscore (ie. _name).</li>
		<li>Keep constructors as simple as possible.  They should NOT throw exceptions.  If exception
		handling is needed, use a factory method.</li>
		<li>The ternary operator is great as long as the conditions are very simple.</li>
		<li>Avoid assignment in conditionals -- extract to method instead</li>
		<li>Avoid magic numbers, use a nested enum or an inner class with public const members instead.</li>
		<li>Use spaces after punctuation such as commas and spaces, in accordance with standard written grammar.
		For example, please include spaces after semi-colons, between equals signs and after keywords
<pre> for (int i = 0; i < array.Count; i++): </pre>
		</li>
	</ul>
