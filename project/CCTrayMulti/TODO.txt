Still to do:

DONE - Create an aggregating/composite project monitor; subscribe to events on this to update form icon and popup messages
DONE - Integrate tray icon stuff; keep icon up to date
DONE - Integrate popup message stuff; popup message on build
DONE - Implement right-click on projects, "display web page" and "force build"
DONE - Implement double-click on projects (=display web page)
DONE - Error handling when e.g. config file is bad
DONE - display the error message that was receieved when "not connected"
DONE - update csproj so builds to same location as all the other projects
DONE - Hide the main window when minimised (just like msn messenger behaviour?)
- Play sounds on build transition 
DONE - ability to switch off balloon popups
- Settings dialog to allow specification of projects, sounds etc
- Fix threading -- create a decorator around IProjectMonitor that uses ISynchronisedInvoke to get the event 
	across to the winforms thread? (though the current winforms thread rule breakage doesn't seem to be causing
	any odd behaviour)
- Display more information about projects on tray tooltip 
- Display more information about projects on list view tooltip (or maybe show more information in the list view columns?)
- Read project list from dashboard
- obtain project status going via the dashboard not direct via remoting?
