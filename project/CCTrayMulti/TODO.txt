Still to do:

DONE - Create an aggregating/composite project monitor; subscribe to events on this to update form icon and popup messages
DONE - Integrate tray icon stuff; keep icon up to date
DONE - Integrate popup message stuff; popup message on build
DONE - Implement right-click on projects, "display web page" and "force build"
DONE - Implement double-click on projects (=display web page)
DONE - Error handling when e.g. config file is bad
DONE - display the error message that was receieved when "not connected"
DONE - update csproj so builds to same location as all the other projects
DONE - Hide the main window when minimised (just like msn messenger behaviour?)
DONE - ability to switch off balloon popups
DONE - Fix threading -- create a decorator around IProjectMonitor that uses ISynchronisedInvoke to get the event 
	across to the winforms thread? (though the current winforms thread rule breakage doesn't seem to be causing
	any odd behaviour)
DONE - Settings dialog to allow specification of projects, sounds etc
- Play sounds on build transition 
- Display more information about projects on tray tooltip 
- right click menu on toolbar icon
- close button should minimise not close (hide minimse/maximise?)
- add to zip file (in parallel with cctray) so people can try it out
- fix issue with window sometimes not reappearing when clicking on tray icon (threading fix should fix this)
- Read project list from dashboard
- obtain project status going via the dashboard not direct via remoting?
- document on confluence
- install as part of msi
