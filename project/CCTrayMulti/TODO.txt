Still to do:

DONE - Create an aggregating/composite project monitor; subscribe to events on this to update form icon and popup messages
DONE - Integrate tray icon stuff; keep icon up to date
DONE - Integrate popup message stuff; popup message on build
- Implement right-click on projects, "display web page" and "force build"
- Implement double-click on projects
- Hide the main window when minimised (just like msn messenger behaviour?)
- Play sounds on build transition 
- Fix threading -- create a decorator around IProjectMonitor that uses ISynchronisedInvoke to get the event 
	across to the winforms thread?
- Display more information about projects on tray tooltip 
- Display more information about projects on list view tooltip
- Settings dialog to allow specification of projects
- Error handling when e.g. config file is bad
- display error message when "not connected"
- Read project list from dashboard
